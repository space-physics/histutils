"""
Estimates time of DMC frames using GPS & fire data, when they exist.
work in progress

We use UT1 Unix epoch time instead of datetime, since we are working with HDF5 and also need to do fast comparisons

Outputs:
--------
    UT1_unix:   double-precision float (64-bit) estimate of frame exposure START
